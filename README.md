# Figma Plugin DS Svelte

WORK IN PROGRESSâ€”This is a version of the Figma Plugin DS specifically for use in creating Figma Plugins. I decided to create this because Svelte seems like a great lightweight approach well suited for creating Figma plugins, and also simplifies the developer experience over using the vanilla JS Figma Plugin DS that I created with easier markup.

You can also get started with [Figsvelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figsvelte), a boilerplate for Figma plugins that already has this library setup as a dependency.

## Installation

To install into your own Svelte project.
`npm -D figma-plugin-ds-svelte`

## Usage

```javascript
//import the global css which includes Figma color, spacing, and type vars and a basic set of utility classes
import { GlobalCSS } from 'figma-plugin-ds-svelte';

//import the desired components
import { Button, Input, SelectMenu } from 'figma-plugin-ds-svelte';
```
